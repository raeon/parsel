## Usage
In this section we'll start with a typical example, followed by an in-depth explanation for how to build your grammar from scratch.

### Example
The following is an implementation of a parser that parses simple mathematical expressions:

```lua
local parsel = require('parsel')
local literal, pattern = parsel.Literal, parsel.Pattern

--[[
    Building the grammar
]]
local g = parsel.Grammar()

-- Ignore all whitespace characters
g:ignore(pattern('%s+'))

-- Terminal symbols
g:define('sum-op', literal '+')
g:define('sum-op', literal '-')
g:define('product-op', literal '*')
g:define('product-op', literal '/')
g:define('lparen', literal '(')
g:define('rparen', literal ')')
g:define('number', pattern '[0-9]+')

-- Defining nonterminal productions
g:define('sum', 'sum', 'sum-op', 'product')
g:define('sum', 'product')

g:define('product', 'product', 'product-op', 'factor')
g:define('product', 'factor')

g:define('factor', 'lparen', 'sum', 'rparen')
g:define('factor', 'number')

--[[
    Parsing input
]]

-- Parsing the input using the 'sum' productions
local parse = g:parser('sum')
local results, err = parse('1 + 2 * (3 - (4 + 5))')

-- Handle errors
if err then
    print(err)
    return
end

-- Handle ambiguity
if #results > 1 then
    print('The input is ambiguous for the given grammar!')
    return
end

--[[
    Refining the parse tree
]]
local tree = results[1]

-- Strip unneeded symbols from parse tree
tree:strip('lparen')
tree:strip('rparen')

-- Remove unneeded intermediary nonterminals from the parse tree
tree:dissolve('sum-op')
tree:dissolve('product-op')

-- Simplifying the parse tree
tree:shorten('sum') -- replaces "sum" matches with "product"
tree:shorten('product')
tree:shorten('factor') -- replaces factor with either the "sum" or the "number"

-- Transforming the parse tree
tree:transform('number', function(node)
    -- the "number" nonterminal always has 1 child: a terminal node!
    return tonumber(node.children[1].value) -- convert the string to a number
end)

print(tree)
```

Running this example code yields the following output:
```
sum(1, "+", product(2, "*", sum(3, "-", sum(4, "+", 5))))
```

### Defining a grammar
Defining your own grammar is easy! Just create a new `Grammar` object like so:
```lua
local parsel = require('parsel')
local grammar = parsel.Grammar
local literal = parsel.Literal
local pattern = parsel.Pattern
local consumer = parsel.Consumer

local g = grammar()
```
From here on out we will define symbols.

#### Terminals
Using this grammar object you can start defining your terminal and nonterminal symbols. Currently, there are three types of terminal symbols available for use: the `Literal`, the `Pattern` and the `Consumer`. As the names suggest, the `Literal` is an exact match of the string you pass it. The `Pattern` only matches the Lua pattern you give it, which is particularly useful when you want to match numbers (`[0-9]+`) or identifiers (`[a-zA-Z]+`). This looks like so (continuing from the previous snippet):
```lua
g:define('number', pattern '[0-9]+')
g:define('identifier', pattern '[a-zA-Z]+')
```
**Note:** The `pattern '[0-9]+'` is a function call using an alternative syntax supported by Lua. It is syntactically equivalent to calling the function normally, like so: `pattern('[0-9]+')`.

Lastly, the `Consumer` can be used in cases where input validation requirements are higher than the `Pattern` can accommodate. An example of this may be back-referencing existing capture groups, which is a feature that Lua patterns do not provide. If you want to, for example, parse an array of characters with an increasing value, you could do that as such:
```lua
g:define('increasing', consumer('increasing', function(input, index)
    local pos = index
    local last = nil

    while true do
        if pos > #input then break end

        local char = input:sub(pos, pos)
        print('char:', char)
        if (not last) or (char:byte() >= last:byte()) then
            pos = pos + 1
            last = char
        else
            break
        end
    end

    if not last then
        return nil, nil
    else
        return input:sub(index, pos), pos - index
    end
end))
```

##### Priorities
Sometimes, you have multiple tokens in your grammar that are ambiguous. For example, in many programming languages you have the `>`, the `>=` and the `=` operator. `parsel` works by first tokenizing the input using all defined terminals. However, as you might have deduced already, it is possible for the tokenizer to misinterpret a `>=` as both a `>` and a `=` token. This is clearly undesirable! For this reason, you can pass another argument to the `Literal`, `Parser` or `Consumer` functions: the priority. By default, the priority is `0`. For this example we would want to assign a higher priority to the `>=` operator, which could be done like this:
```lua
g:define('greater', literal '>')
g:define('greater-or-equal', literal('>=', 500))
g:define('assignment', literal '=')
```

**Warning: Priorities below zero are ignored!** They are used internally by the `g:ignore(...)` function. Therefore, you should always use zero or greater as your priority.

#### Nonterminals
Now that we have our terminals ready, we can start composing our nonterminal symbols. For this example, let's say we want to parse any number of `number`s followed by a single `identifier` symbol. We can accomplish this by defining a recursive symbol.
```lua
g:define('sequence', 'number', 'sequence')
g:define('sequence', 'identifier')
```
What we've done here is define the nonterminal `sequence` with two possible ways to get there: If we encounter a `number` it will parse it and then try to parse another `sequence`. If it encounters an `identifier`, it will immediately finish parsing the current `sequence`. This allows you to parse multiple of the same token in a sequence.

#### Ignored terminals
Sometimes we want to flat-out ignore some `Literal`, `Pattern` or `Consumer`. In our example, we wish to allow an arbitrary amount of whitespace between symbols. We accomplish this like so:
```lua
g:ignore(pattern '%s+')
```

### Parsing
Now that we're done defining our simple grammar, we can get to parsing it. Construct a parser using `sequence` as the root production:
```lua
local parser = g:parser('sequence')
```
Now we can pass our input string (and optionally a starting index in the input string) and get an abstract syntax tree (AST):
```lua
local results, err = parser('12 34 56 hello')
```
**Note:** If you pass an index as the second argument to the parser, keep in mind that Lua starts counting at 1. For example, if you use index 2, you will begin parsing at the '2' character.

### Error handling
If the parser encounters any unexpected tokens or unrecognized characters, it will give a fancy error. Let's handle this scenario:
```lua
if err then
    print(err)
    return
end
```
A typical error could look like this:
```
Error: unexpected end of file at line 1 char 15:

    1 + (2 * 3 - 4
                  ^
```

### Result manipulation
Since we're working with an Earley parser, we get back every possible interpretation of the given input. This means that if your grammar is ambiguous, you will get all possible results back! Typically this is not what you want, so you can either ignore all results past the first one, or ensure that your grammar is not ambiguous.

So, what is this `results` object we got back? It's just a table of abstract syntax trees! Let's check for ambiguity and error if we have multiple results:
```lua
if #results > 1 then
    print('The given input is ambiguous with this grammar!')
    return
end
```

Now that we're sure there is only *one* parse tree, let's find out what it looks like:
```lua
local tree = results[1]
print(tree)
```

If you run this code, the output looks like this:
```
sequence(number("12"), sequence(number("34"), sequence(number("56"), sequence(identifier("hello")))))
```

This may appear somewhat nonsensical, so here it is in tree form:
```
       sequence
       /      \
   number     sequence
     |        /      \
   "12"   number     sequence
            |        /      \
          "34"    number   sequence
                    |         |
                  "56"    identifier
                              |
                           "hello"
```

**Note:** `parsel` does not come with functionality to let you print fancy trees like this one, but you could always write it yourself. :-)

#### Flattening

For this section, we'll continue using our example from before. As expected, the resulting parse tree has the right-recursion we embedded in our grammar. However, in our case, we didn't actually *want* a right-recursive parse tree, we merely wanted to have a sequence of `number`s followed by a single `identifier`.

Luckily for us, `parsel` has just the tools we need! We can simply tell the parse tree to *flatten* all `sequence` nonterminals like so:
```lua
tree:flatten('sequence')
```

If we now print the parse tree again, we get the following:
```
sequence(number("12"), number("34"), number("56"), identifier("hello"))
```

Again, in tree form:
```
              sequence
        _________/\_________
       /       /    \       \
   number  number  number  identifier
     |       |       |         |
   "12"    "34"     "56"     "hello"
```

Neat! Now we no longer have to deal with recursion when we try to interpret `sequence` symbols.

#### Dissolving
It might occur that you have intermediate nonterminal nodes that you do not care for. This can be the case if they are necessary merely for the correctness of your grammar. In this case you can *dissolve* these nodes.

**Note:** You cannot dissolve the root node.

Let's use the following tree as an example:
```
              root
                |
            container
              /    \
           split    box
           /   \     |
         box   box  end
          |     |
         end   end
```

There are **two** ways to use the `dissolve()` function.

##### Targeting type
Let's say we want to dissolve all the `box` nodes. We can do this as such:
```lua
tree:dissolve('box')
```

Doing this will yield the following tree:
```
              root
                |
            container
              /    \
           split   end
           /   \
         end   end  
```

##### Targeting child types
Let's say we don't want to dissolve _all_ `box` nodes, but just the ones that are under the `split` node. In this case we can specify the parent and child types of the nodes we want to dissolve, for example:
```lua
-- There are two ways to dissolve using child type(s):
tree:dissolve('split', 'box') -- using a single child type
tree:dissolve('split', {'box', ...}) -- using multiple child types at once
```

This will dissolve the `box` only when it is child to the `split` node, which means the `box` node under the `container` node remains intact. This will yield the following tree:
```
              root
                |
            container
              /    \
           split    box
           /   \     |
         end   end  end
```

#### Shortening
Similar to `dissolve()`, but will only dissolve a node if it has exactly *one* child node. This can be useful if you want to dissolve nodes only if they (visibly) give you no additional information.

In a real-world scenario, it might occur that you have a grammar defined in such a way that it enforces operator precedence to be interpreted correctly. A parse tree produced by such a grammar may look like this:
```
            expression
                |
               sum
                |
             product
                |
              number
                |
               "52"
```
Note how in the above tree diagram there is merely one branch. This could happen if the input is simply a number that does not use any of the possible operators. In this scenario it may not be useful for us to see a `sum` or `product` during traversal when there is no addition/subtraction or multiplication/division happening. This is where `shorten()` comes to save the day.

If we have the above parse tree stored in a variable called `tree`, we could do the following to remove the useless nonterminals we don't care about:
```lua
tree:shorten('sum')
tree:shorten('product')
```

What this does is scan through the tree, and *replace* any node of the given type (in our case `sum` or `product`) with their only child. **This means that if the node has multiple children, it is kept intact.** It is only removed if it has only one child.

**Note:** If the root node (the object on which you call the function) needs to be shortened as well, be sure use the **return value** of the call, like so: `tree = tree:shorten(type)`. It is however not recommended to shorten the root node since it may return a terminal symbol as the new root node, which may interfere with any traversal happening hereafter.

#### Terminating
For convenience, instead of having to do `node.children[1].value` you can `terminate()` a node at a given type. This will take the value from the nodes' children and set the `value` field of the nodes up until the given type.

Let's assume we have the following tree:
```
        root   <-- no '.value'
         |
       value   <-- no '.value'
         |
       number  <-- no '.value'
         |
        '4'    <-- '.value' of '4'
```

If we want to be able to fetch the `value` field from the `number` or `value` node without having to go down to the `'4'` node itself, we can simply terminate the chain at the `value` node like so:
```lua
tree:terminate('value')
```

This will copy the `value` from the lowest levels of the tree upwards, resulting in the following tree:
```
        root   <-- no '.value'
         |
       value   <-- '.value' of '4'
         |
       number  <-- '.value' of '4'
         |
        '4'    <-- '.value' of '4'
```

You might be wondering what happens if there are several terminal nodes under the nonterminal node that we are terminating. Consider the following example:
```
            sentence
       _____/ |  | \_____
      /      /    \      \
    word   word   word   word
      |      |     |       |
   'this'  'is'   'a'  'sentence'     
```

In such a case the default behaviour is for all child values to be concatenated. Terminating the `sentence` node would therefore yield a `value` of `thisisasentence`. This may be undesirable, so it is possible to provide either a string that will be placed between all parts, or to provide a function that will deal with the concatenation:
```
-- terminate using a string
tree:terminate('sentence', ' ')

-- terminate using a concatenation function
tree:terminate('sentence', function(left, right)
    return left .. ' ' .. right
end)
```

Both of these options would cause the `sentence` node to end with a `value` of `this is a sentence`.

#### Transforming
For some use-cases, the parse tree returned by `parsel` is sufficient. However, a lot of times it just happens that we want to store more data and functions in the nodes of the parse tree. We could always just store more data (since everything in Lua is a table), but that becomes messy quickly and does not allow us to cleanly add methods. In such scenarios it may be useful to transform the nodes of the parse tree to another type.

An excellent example of this is converting the `number` nodes to *actual numbers*, since they are just strings for now. We can do this by writing a *transformation function*: a function that that takes a `number` node and returns a real number. Let's write this function and apply it straight away:
```lua
tree:transform('number', function(node)
    return tonumber(node.children[1].value)
end)
```
**Whoa- hold on there.** This seems illogical. You might be wondering why we didn't do the following:
```lua
tree:transform('number', function(node)
    return tonumber(node.value)
end)
```

The reason for this is actually quite simple. If we look back at our definition of `number`, we see the following:
```lua
g:define('number', pattern '[0-9]+')
```

**We defined `number` as a nonterminal.** This means that `number` is merely a wrapper for the terminal symbol `Pattern('[0-9]+')`. This is why we grab the *first child* from the container, which is the `Pattern`, and convert it's `value` field to a number.

**Note:** If the root node (the object on which you call the function) needs to be transformed as well, be sure use the **return value** of the call, like so: `tree = tree:transform(...)`.

After the transformation, we get the following AST:
```
sequence(12, 34, 56, identifier("hello"))
```

Nice and simple!

#### Stripping
In grammars, it may occur that there are some terminal symbols that are used merely for disambiguation. An example of this is if we were to parse, for example, a function call `func(arg1, arg2, arg2, ..., argN)` we don't need to remember the left/right parenthesis or the commas. For cases like this, we can strip the symbols from the parse tree:
```lua
g:define('lparen', literal '(')
g:define('lparen', literal ')')
g:define('comma', literal ',')

...

tree:strip('lparen')
tree:strip('rparen')
tree:strip('comma')
```
Now we're certain all symbols we encounter are significant to our understanding of the parsed input.

## Quick reference

Internal methods are not shown here for the sake of being a *quick* reference.

### Grammar
- `Grammar()` constructs a new Grammar instance
- `grammar:define(name, symbols..)` defines production `name` -> `symbols`
- `grammar:ignore(symbol)` ignores the given symbol completely during tokenization
- `grammer:parser(name)` returns a Parser using the rule(s) as the root production

### Literal
- `Literal(value[, priority])` constructs a new literal terminal symbol that parses the literal string `value` with priority `priority` (default: 0).
- `tostring(literal)` the `value` string passed during construction

### Pattern
- `Pattern(value[, priority])` constructs a new pattern terminal symbol that parses the Lua pattern `value` with priority `priority` (default: 0)
- `tostring(pattern)` the `value` string passed during construction

### Consumer
- `Consumer(name, func[, priority])` constructs a new consumer terminal symbol that uses the given function to tokenize the input, with priority `priority` (default: 0)
- `tostring(consumer)` the `name` string passed during construction

### Parser
- `parser(input[, index])` parses `input`, optionally starting at index `index`. returns a list of root nodes and an error string.

### Node
- `node.type` the type of this node (name of nonterminal or a `Literal` or `Pattern` instance)
- `node.value` if this node is a terminal, the raw string represented by this terminal. nil otherwise.
- `node.position` the position where this symbol starts: an object with keys `index`, `line` and `column`, all numbers.
- `node.children` table of `Node` instances (empty table for terminals)
- `node:strip(type)` removes all nodes with type `type`
- `node:merge(type)` merges nodes of type `type` into their parent if their parent is also of type `type`.
- `node:flatten(type)` for all nodes of type `type`, if they have exactly one child, the node is replaced with their child.
- `node:transform(type, fn)` replaces all nodes of type `type` with the result of `fn(node)`.
- `node:string()` returns the literal value for this node and it's children
- `node:isTerminal()` whether this is a terminal symbol or not
- `tostring(node)` converts this node to a string representation
